node-bitcoin-utils
==================

Utils for writing minimal Bitcoin utilities in Node.js that don't use the blockchain. (Useful for generating multi-signature transactions offline, for example.)

Not really in human-consumable form right now. Finally got the encodeBase58 function returning correct Bitcoin addresses, so I'm committing it for now and calling it a night. Will prettify and split up into proper modules later.
