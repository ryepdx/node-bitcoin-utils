node-bitcoin-utils
==================

Barebone Bitcoin utilities for supporting Node.js Bitcoin services.

Not really in human-consumable form right now. Finally got the encodeBase58 function returning correct Bitcoin addresses, so I'm committing it for now and calling it a night. Will prettify and split up into proper modules later.
